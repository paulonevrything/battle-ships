# Battle Ships

This is my implementation of the Battle ships game in C#. It's a one-sided game against the computer with 3 ships on the battle field, 1 Battleship and 2 Destroyers. There's 15 rounds for the user to shoot.

## User Interface

-   A simple command line interface for the user to input their shot locations.
-   There's ample instructions to help the user understand wha they need to do, and there's feedback on each shot.


## Likely Improvements

-   More ships can be added to the battle field.
-   There's an opportunity for the game to be two sided with the computer also playing against the user.
-   More test coverage
-   User interface could be better
